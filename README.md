Library Management System in Python ðŸ“š
This repository contains a Python program that simulates a basic Library Management System. The program allows users to manage library resources such as books, magazines, and DVDs, providing essential functionalities to streamline library operations.
Features:
â€¢	Add New Items: Add books, magazines, or DVDs to the library inventory.
â€¢	Checkout and Return Items: Manage the borrowing and returning of library resources.
â€¢	Overdue Fines Management: Calculate and handle overdue fines for late returns.
â€¢	Search Functionality: Search library items by: 
o	Title
o	Author
o	Category
How It Works:
1.	The program maintains a record of library items and their details.
2.	Users can perform various operations, including adding resources, checking out items, and processing returns.
3.	Overdue fines are calculated based on the return date.
4.	Search functionality makes it easy to locate items by specific attributes.
Usage:
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Run the Python script in a terminal or IDE.
3.	Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the system.
Key Concepts Demonstrated:
â€¢	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for representing library resources and functionalities.
â€¢	Data management with lists or dictionaries.
â€¢	Input validation and user interaction.
â€¢	Basic date and time handling for overdue fines.
Future Enhancements (Optional):
â€¢	Integration with a database for persistent storage.
â€¢	User authentication for secure operations.
â€¢	Advanced search features, such as filters and sorting options.
